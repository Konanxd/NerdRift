                    <p><span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/long.png">Long Sword</span> is the best starting items since you can get more damage for securing last hit. You can also take <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/sapphire.png">Sapphire Crystal</span> for early stack of Mana Charge. However, you will have to play safely especially against early poking champions. Your next item for the first recall is going to be <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/tear.png">Tear of Goddess</span> (if you bought <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/sapphire.png">Sapphire Crystal</span>, you can buy <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/long.png">Long Sword</span> for extra damage for securing last hit. You can also skip it into <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/sheen.png">Sheen</span> for aggressive play.). This is the item you should prioritize because it will saving time for stacking the passive into <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/muramana.png">Muramana</span>. For the next item, you should get <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/sheen.png">Sheen</span> since it grants you <span class="ad">100% base <b>AD</b> bonus</span> <span class="physical">physical damage on-hit</span>. If you against regen, healer, or lifestealer champion, you should buy <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/executioner.png">Executioner's Calling</span> for the anti-heal (Grievious Wound) effect so the enemy will get a less of HP healing.</p>
                    <p>After you bought <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/sheen.png">Sheen</span>, you can get <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/manamune.png">Manamune</span> for the mana sustain and damage that depends on your <span class="magic">1,5% <b>maximum</b> mana</span>.</p>

                    <p><span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinity Force</span> is the core item for <span><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Ezreal.png">Ezreal</span> because it will increase your damage after using ability for <span class="ad">200% base <b>AD</b> bonus</span> <span class="physical">physical damage on-hit</span>. Therefore, <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinity Force</span> is the best pair for <span><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Ezreal.png">Ezreal</span>, even better than <span><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Lux.png">Lux</span> and MORE THAN <span><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Zoe.png">Zoe</span> (sorry shipper). He is relying on his 1st ability, <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S1.png">Mystic Shot</span>, and it applies to <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinity Force</span> passive because it has low cooldown and you should abuse it.</p>
                    <p>Furthemore, <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/iceborn.png">Iceborn Gauntlet</span> also can be the alternative of <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinity Force</span> since it still give you the <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/sheen.png">Sheen</span> passive yet it only has <span class="ad">100% base <b>AD</b> bonus</span> <span class="physical">physical damage on-hit</span> that scales with <span class="armor">+25% <b>bonus</b> armor</span>. However, it has icy zone that also can slow the enemies and deal a damage around it same as the bonus damage stat and the zone radius is depends on the <span class="armor">+55% <b>bonus</b> armor</span>.</p>
                    <p>If you in winning condition, you can buy and upgrade your boots into <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/ionian.png">Ionian Boots of Lucidity</span> for Ability Haste or <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/gluttonous.png">Gluttonous Greaves</span> for <span class="vamp">omnivamp</span>. You can buy <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/ionian.png">Ionian Boots of Lucidity</span> when your build purpose will have enough lifesteal.

                    <p>If you in losing condition due to having a 1v2 situation in the early game since your support don't even know how to play nor engage the fight and then he's throwing up by having a lot of death in the scoreboard or might be because of you don't know how to play properly and then everyone in the team got tilted because how the duo laner messed up their lane, you can skip the boots and do some farm until you get your <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinty Force</span>. The game is not ended yet, so just keep farming for the recovery.</p>
                    <p><span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/serylda.png">Serylda's Grudge</span> is good as the next when you in winning condition and there is no regen, heal, or lifesteal champions since it has an Armor Penetration and Ability Haste. Even there is a tank or bruiser, rushing this item when in winning condition is a good choice.</p>
                    <p>When you matchup against 2+ tank or bruiser or in losing condition and having the same matchup, you can rush <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/botrk.png">Blade of the Ruined King</span> as the third item because the damage is scaling with the enemy HP.</p>
                    <p>You also can burst down the squishy enemy with <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/riftmaker.png">Riftmaker</span> since it has true damage passive when you in combat. Also, it grants you <span class="vamp">15% omnivamp</span>.</p>
                    <p>Facing against burst champion (especially <span class="ap">AP</span> champion) is really tough for <span><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Ezreal.png">Ezreal</span>. <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/maw.png">Maw of Malmortius</span> will prevent you from getting burst with the magic resistant and Lifeline effect.</p>
                    <p>For the boots upgrade, <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/stasis.png">Stasis Enchant</span> will helps your aggressive playstyle while <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/quicksilver.png">Quicksilver Enchant</span> will save you from a lot of crowd control.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Depends on the rune that you used (especially Domination rune) and matchup, Ezreal can be pretty weak in the laning phase. If your support aggressive type like <span class="team"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Leona.png">Leona</span>, <span class="team"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Thresh.png">Thresh</span>, and <span class="team"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Nautilus.png">Nautilus</span>, you can join the trade after your support landed the crowd control. When that happen, use your W <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S2.png">Essence Flux</span> + E <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S3.png">Arcane Shift</span> to take a close position and then if there's no minion at front of you, use <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S1.png">Mystic Shot</span> and AA. When you reach level 5, you can start your combo with your ultimate <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S4.png">Trueshot Barrage</span> in the bush so the enemy wont react it quickly. If your support other than that, just farm with your Q <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S1.png">Mystic Shot</span> and do some poke damage to the enemy. You can bait your enemy with the  W <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S2.png">Essence Flux</span> + E <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S3.png">Arcane Shift</span> once the enemy wasted their ability. Remember, SURVIVING IN THE LANING PHASE IS IMPORTANT.</p>
                    <p>The thing you should remember is ALWAYS PUSH THE LANE WHENEVER YOU NEED TO RECALL (1 wave = 1 kill). If you missed, the enemy will push your lane to the allies tower and you will miss some last hit and that means you delayed your items timing. Other thing is "It's okay to use your AA often if there's a Minion blocking you." since AA is a guarantee hit and your Q <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S1.png">Mystic Shot</span> need an aim first.</p>
                    <p>Everytime your teammate pinging a missing enemy, be aware of it. It can be the enemy mid laner or jungler that will gank into your lane. Keep an eye for a bit at your map because macro is the thing that will save you everytime.</p>
                    <p>For the usage of your ability, never do tap unless you close to your target. Aim it further whenever the target want to go. You can also combo your ability with your flash for a guarantee hit especially for your ultimate <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S4.png">Trueshot Barrage</span>.</p>
                    <p>For most of the time, don't waste your W <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S2.png">Essnce Flux</span> and E <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S3.png">Arcane Shift</span>. W <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S2.png">Essence Flux</span> is your source for extra damage that can burst the enemy into a potential kill moment. E <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S3.png">Arcane Shift</span> is your escape tools after <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/spell/Flash.png">Flash</span> that will save your since <span class="team"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Ezreal.png">Ezreal</span> is squishy.</p>
                    <p>When the first dragon spawned while there is a wave in the lane and the enemy haven't come to the river, shove the wave so the enemy tower could get shred as a small punish strategy. If the enemy wave pushed to your lane instead and the enemy have came to the river or pit, leave it and start a fight with your team. In this case, never try to jump ahead or take a position inside the pit since it will be a bad position even you have a flash or another E <span class="ability"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/ability/Ezreal/S3.png">Arcane Shift</span>. If you at the pit, you will get burst by the enemy and die. Take a furthest poisition between you and your enemy so you won't get jump by the enemy assassin or mage. Also, try not to always stick with your teammate since their also can be the target or a bridge to reach into you.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>After got your <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/manamune.png">Manamune</span>, clear your lane if you haven't destroy the enemy tower. You can just keep farm and join the fight if it's close to you. You need to get your <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinity Force</span> for damage spike. Once you get it, try to slow push by killing the melee and range Minion and leave the siege last. If there's any a fight, try to join since even you get some assist, gold still a gold. You also need to get your third item as fast as possible for your power spike. Usually, your third item would be a counter items but when you too ahead from foes, just get <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/serylda.png">Serylda's Grudge</span> or <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/riftmaker.png">Riftmaker</span> for guarantee kill.</p>
                    <p>For positioning, same as at early game before, try not to close with your teammate especially when you have bounty on your head because everyone will try to hunt you down and take the reward from you. Once you dead, there is no other dps in the team (if your team sucks). Never try to jump into crowd unless there is your front liner in there. Sometimes, even it's there, I wouldn't recommend that act since you're an ADC and you're the priority target for your enemies.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>First, I would say the important thing. DON'T BE MAD IF YOU LOSE YOUR LANE AND THE GAME IS NOT ENDED YET! Mentality is the key to carry your teammate and even yourself to the goal. In this case, you should farm more often like taking jungle camp, clearing the lane, and even igonring a fight if there's not a guaranted kill in it. Your goal in this time is to get your <span><img src="./multimedia/images/items/trinity.png">Trinity Force</span> as quick as possible. With it, you will able to join the fight and secure some kill that potentially will bring you to the next item in short times. If there any non-escape champions in the enemy line, kill first for your guarantee gold if it's possible. Always do lock target and use that feature because it helps you a lot for targeting especially when you ran out of ability.</p>

                <div class="sub-title">
                    <p>Late Game (Winning Condition)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Keep playing for objective especially for tower. At late game, you can farm more less since you have to end the game before going to more late. <span class="team"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Ezreal.png">Ezreal</span> is pretty weak in the late game because everyone could catch up the net worth if they're succeed on picking off enemy.</p>
                    <p>Tank can be more tanky, carry can be more aggressive, bruiser can rush you down, assassin or mage can one shot you. Overall, late game is a difficult situation if you not end the game quickly.</p>
                    <p>Offensive warding can also be useful because you can do a better fight since you and your whole team can see the enemy ability that used.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>This is a difficult situation for <span class="team"><img src="./multimedia/images/champions/Ezreal.png">Ezreal</span>. Whenever he's behind, it's hard to deal a decent damage esepecially into tanky enemy. Just like mid game situation, keep farm until your counter items is ready and just do some amount of poking damage and hopefully you and your teammate can execute the enemy. Keep split pushing for a while and go back if there is no vision or enemy on the map. Ward more often to increase your awarness especially when you walk passing river.</p>
